# Crazyflie-PPO-Training
PPO Training Methods for Crazyflie Drone

This project is based off of https://github.com/utiasDSL/gym-pybullet-drones.git

I have implemented for training a drone to fly with each individual motor being a system input, updated the rewards to allow for feasable training, created a model with an inverted pendulum, and to have a new RPM action space "rpm2"
